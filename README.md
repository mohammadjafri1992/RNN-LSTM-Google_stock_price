# RNN-LSTM-Google_stock_price
This projects models and predicts Google stock prices in Jan 2017, by learning from the data provided by the years from 2012-2016.

Only trading days are included, therefore we only have 1257 entries and 6 dataset features i.e.
  1. Date
  2. Open price
  3. High price
  4. Low price
  5. Closing price
  6. Total Volume

WARNING!
***Please note that this is not a stock picking suggestion! This is a project which solely demonstrates the nature of LSTM and how they can be applied on anything whose outcome might depend on the previous state of the system***
